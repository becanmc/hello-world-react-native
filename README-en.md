# Hello, React Native!
This is my first project with React Native.

The project consists of learning basic structures, components and familiarity with the framework.

There's only one (1) screen, where the user has to input how many Grammys Adele already won.

## How to start the project
1. Clone the repo into your machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/becanmc/hello-world-react-native.git
```

2. Open the project:
```bash
cd ./hello-world-react-native/project
```

3. Install the requirements:
```bash
npm install
```

4. Run the project:
```bash
npx expo start
```

5. Scan the QRCode with your phone (You'll need Expo Go) or follow the instructions displayed in the terminal menu.
